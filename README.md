# HelicopterGame
For all the 90s kids, this was one of the most favorite games and very easy to implement! In this project, we will use SDL graphics. The game is to move the helicopter forward without touching the obstacles. The player should control the game through keys, and holding the key moves the helicopter, and releasing it will bring the helicopter down.
